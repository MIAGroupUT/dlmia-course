The data that we will be using today consists of chest X-ray images. The end goal in this dataset is to segment the ribs in these images, as in the image below. However, we will start a bit simpler and just segment every pixel that is a rib. \n",

You can imagine that if you train multiple networks with different settings, it's easy to lose track of all loss curves and figure out which model is best. Luckily, there exist excellent so-called MLOps systems to keep track of your experiments. Examples are Tensorboard, Neptune, and Weights & Biases (wandb). Here, we will give you some tips on how to use this last one to keep track of your experiments. Setting everything up is a simple process:\n",

    "In this part of the tutorial, you will train a convolutional neural network for automatic segmentation of ribs in a chest X-ray image. You will examine the effects of using different loss functions, data augmentations and network architectures. To keep track of all these parameters, we will use wandb.\n",

    "### Build a CacheDataset\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the notebook, you defined the path to the rib data. We will now use it to find and load the corresponding images.\n",
    "The data consists of an image and a label. However, the label is in this case not a binary label, but a segmentation mask. Both the segmentation masks and the X-rays are .png files and can be opened using the PIL library.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial we are not going to code the Dataset class ourselves but instead use a Monai class: [`CacheDataset`](https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/data.html#cachedataset). It has two main advantages:\n",
    "- as the name suggests, it uses a [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)) mechanism, which means that it is memory efficient (this is partly explained later).\n",
    "- everything is pre-built, so no need to code the `__init__`, `__getitem__` and `__len__` functions anymore. \n",
    "\n",
    "`CacheDataset` only needs the list of your data samples to work. As we are learning a segmentation task, one data sample is composed of two images: the chest X-ray (named `img`) and the mask of the ribs (named `mask`). With Python, we represent this data sample with a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yLI4sJz.png\" alt=\"sample\" width=\"450\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we could give this kind of list to `CacheDataset` to create our data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/r7JJTgY.png\" alt=\"list of samples\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as this list contains all the images, it means that all the images are always in Python memory even though they are not currently used so this is very inefficient. This is why we don't directly give  the images to `CacheDataset`, but the paths to find them on our disk. Then we also need to give a `Transform` object, `LoadRibData` which will transform these paths into the corresponding images only when they are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JacrPFO.png\" alt=\"list of paths\" width=\"650\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/EUWJj4r.png\" alt=\"transform path to image\" width=\"430\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As we don't want to write this list of paths manually, we write the function `build_dict_ribs` which automatically computes it based on the root folder of the data directory `data_path`. This is possible because fortunately your teachers pre-organized the dataset for this tutorial, but be aware that most medical datasets require a lot of cleaning up prior to this."

    "[Data augmentation](https://d2l.ai/chapter_computer-vision/image-augmentation.html#image-augmentation) is a very common way to enlarge the number of training samples that you use. By applying transformations such as rotation, flipping, scaling to images we *artificially* enlarge the number of samples that the model sees. \n",

    "\n",

    "The random transforms (for example flipping and rotation) need to be performed in the same way on the input image `'img'` as well as on the label `'mask'`. Monai has [adapted transforms](https://docs.monai.io/en/stable/transforms.html#dictionary-transforms) that take dictionaries as an input, such that random transforms can be performed in the same way for both images: you don't want a different angle of rotation for the image and the mask, as they will become misaligned! You can recognize these transforms as they end with a 'd', e.g. `Zoomd` instead of `Zoom`.\n",

    "2. Apply the transform on a data sample\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, most transforms expect a channel dimension for both 2D and 3D images. As we have only one channel, we should add this extra dimension using the `monai.transforms.AddChanneld` transform first.\n"

The Dice loss is computed over the full mini-batch (`batch=True`) to avoid poorly defined loss in individual batch samples.
